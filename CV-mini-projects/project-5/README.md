## CV-mini-project 5 - Affine Structure from Motion

This project is about Structure from Motion (SfM), a photogrammetric range imaging technique for estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences that may be coupled with local motion signals. The main task was to recover a 3D point cloud from the image sequence `hotel.seq0.png` â€¦ `hotel.seq50.png`.

#### Implementation Details

The main function `affineSFM()` follows the outlined algorithm in the problem statement. 

1. It begins by centering the feature coordinates, subtracting the corresponding centroids. 
2. Then, it constructs the measurement matrix `D`.
3. Following this, it factorizes `D` using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and enforces a rank constraint to prepare for motion and structure matrix construction.
4. The motion (affine) and structure (3D shape) matrices are created.
5. Lastly, the matrix `L` is solved using the three orthonormality conditions to eliminate affine ambiguity.

This implementation also makes use of two helper functions: 

- `remove_nan()`: To handle the 'nan' values in the input data, ensuring the preservation of rows where all values are not 'nan'.
- `orthonormality_residuals()`: To calculate the deviation of the solution from the constraints, which helps in finding the `L` matrix.

#### Visualization

The 3D point cloud and the path of the camera frame motion were successfully recovered and visualized using Matplotlib. The function `plot_3D_points()` was used to create a 3D scatter plot of the recovered structure from different viewpoints. The function `plot_camera_path()` plotted the path of the camera in 3D space for each frame.

The work is built upon the method proposed by Tomasi and Kanade in their 1992 paper titled "Shape and Motion from Image Streams under Orthography: a Factorization Method".
